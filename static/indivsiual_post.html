            <section class="article-content">
                <p>VANCOUVER, BC â€” The expansion of Vancouver's technology sector has reached unprecedented levels, with over 75,000 tech workers now employed across the city. This growth represents a significant shift in the local economy, traditionally dominated by real estate, tourism, and natural resources.</p>
                
                <p>Major tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and local success story Hootsuite have all expanded their operations in the past year, while dozens of new startups have established footholds in neighborhoods like Gastown and Mount Pleasant.</p>

                <p>"We're seeing Vancouver emerge as a genuine competitor to Seattle and San Francisco," said Dr. Sarah Chen, economics professor at BCIT. "The combination of top technical talent, quality of life, and proximity to Asian markets makes Vancouver particularly attractive."</p>
                
                <p>The growth hasn't come without challenges. Housing prices, already among North America's highest, have continued to climb as tech salaries drive up the market. Meanwhile, traditional industries report difficulties competing for talent.</p>

                <p>Local government has responded with incentives aimed at balancing growth across sectors. "We want to ensure Vancouver maintains its diverse economic base while embracing innovation," said Mayor Jackson Lee. "Our new initiatives include tax incentives for companies that hire locally and invest in training programs."</p>
                
                <p>The tech boom has also sparked increased enrollment in technology programs at local educational institutions. BCIT reports a 45% increase in applications to its computing programs compared to five years ago.</p>
                
                <p>"Students recognize where the opportunities are," said BCIT President Dr. Maria Gonzalez. "We're working closely with industry partners to ensure our graduates have the skills needed in this rapidly evolving landscape."</p>
