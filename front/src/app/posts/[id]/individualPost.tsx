        <p>
          VANCOUVER, BC â€” The expansion of Vancouver's technology sector has
          reached unprecedented levels, with over 75,000 tech workers now
          employed across the city. This growth represents a significant shift
          in the local economy, traditionally dominated by real estate, tourism,
          and natural resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Major tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and local success
          story Hootsuite have all expanded their operations in the past year,
          while dozens of new startups have established footholds in
          neighborhoods like Gastown and Mount Pleasant.

          "We're seeing Vancouver emerge as a genuine competitor to Seattle and
          San Francisco," said Dr. Sarah Chen, economics professor at BCIT. "The
          combination of top technical talent, quality of life, and proximity to
          Asian markets makes Vancouver particularly attractive."
        </p>

        <p>
          The growth hasn't come without challenges. Housing prices, already
          among North America's highest, have continued to climb as tech
          salaries drive up the market. Meanwhile, traditional industries report
          difficulties competing for talent.

        <p>
          Local government has responded with incentives aimed at balancing
          growth across sectors. "We want to ensure Vancouver maintains its
          diverse economic base while embracing innovation," said Mayor Jackson
          Lee. "Our new initiatives include tax incentives for companies that
          hire locally and invest in training programs."
        </p>

        <p>
          The tech boom has also sparked increased enrollment in technology
          programs at local educational institutions. BCIT reports a 45%
          increase in applications to its computing programs compared to five
          years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Students recognize where the opportunities are," said BCIT President
          Dr. Maria Gonzalez. "We're working closely with industry partners to
          ensure our graduates have the skills needed in this rapidly evolving
          landscape."
